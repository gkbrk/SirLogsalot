#Compiling#
There are multiple ways to compile SirLogsalot.

1. Running `make` or `make compile` will compile the code and leave an executable called _sirlogsalot_.
2. Running `make run` will compile the code and run the executable in one step.
3. Running `make test` will compile the code and perform memory tests using _valgrind_.
4. Running `make clean` will remove the executable and only leave the code files.
